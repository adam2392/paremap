To Do List:
1) Create separate clustering algorithms for doing different regions of interictal vs. ictal, instead of the 4 regions that Sam defined.
2) Create a logistic regression algorithm to separate interictal vs. ictal. Use training data on half vs. other half...
3) Look into how to do multi logistic regression.
